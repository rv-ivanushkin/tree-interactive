# What's it?

it's a project for understanding how to develop react interactive tree without helped from other libs.


# What's us need for create tree component?

Of course, the first stage is searching examples:
- [Rsuite Tree](https://rsuitejs.com/components/tree/)
- [Quasar Tree](https://quasar.dev/vue-components/tree)
- [Blueprintjs Tree](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#core/components/tree)

Ok, we are having good examples and common information about types of structure.

we'll not take as an example tree component from MUI, i don't like this component.
